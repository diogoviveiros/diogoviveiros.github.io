This project explores whether the EPA's National Walkability Index can predict obesity rates when controlling for socioeconomic and access-related variables.

# Key Question
> Does walkability predict obesity rates when adjusting for other factors?

# Data Sources
- **EPA SMART Location Database** (walkability, job access, land use). [Data Source](https://edg.epa.gov/EPADataCommons/public/OA/EPA_SmartLocationDatabase_V3_Jan_2021_Final.csv&ved=2ahUKEwj7saz6ifaMAxW_6skDHROHNbcQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1UdRhZzOGczkM3felPCxRK)
- **CDC PLACES** (obesity, healthcare access).  [Data Source](https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-County-Data-GIS-Friendly-Format-2024-releas/i46a-9kgh/about_data)

# Methodology   
A multi-variate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model was used to test how walkability affects obesity, adjusting for:

| Variable           | Description                              | Control Purpose                                         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCESS2_AdjPrev`  | % without health insurance               | Controls for disparities in healthcare access            |
| `TotalPopulation`  | County population                        | Proxy for urban vs rural context                         |
| `Ac_Total`         | Total job accessibility                  | Reflects economic development and opportunity            |
| `Ac_Unpr`          | Access to unprotected/unstable jobs      | Captures economic vulnerability                         |
| `Pct_AO0`          | Demographic group %                      | Adjusts for demographic variation in obesity risk        |
| `R_PCTLOWWAGE`     | % earning low wages                      | Controls for income-related health disparities           |
| `NatWalkInd`       | National Walkability Index               | **Primary variable of interest**                         |

# What is NatWalkInd?  
The **National Walkability Index** is a composite EPA score (0–20 scale) that measures:
- Street connectivity (intersection density)  
- Land use diversity  
- Transit proximity  

Higher scores = greater walkability.

# Key Findings 
- Adjusted R² = 0.385 — the model explains ~38.5% of variance in obesity rates. This validates our distribution graph of Obesity distribution between High and Low Walkability areas (separated by a NatWalkInd of 10.5): ![Obesity Distribution Graph](Obesity_Distribution_Graph.png) 
- **Walkability (`NatWalkInd`) was statistically significant** (p < 0.001).  
- **Coefficient = -0.8663**: Each 1-point increase in walkability lowers obesity by ~0.87 percentage points.
