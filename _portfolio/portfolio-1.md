This project is a Flask-based web app that performs text clustering on CSV data ‚Äî ideal for quickly identifying themes or duplicate content from unstructured text.

**How It Works**
- Upload a `.csv` file with `Title` and `Description`.
- Cleans and tokenizes text using a transformer-based model.
- Supports fixed clusters or auto-adjusted based on similarity threshold.
- Cosine similarity used for grouping.

**Why It Matters**
- ‚ö° Fast: Handles a few hundred rows in minutes.  
- üß† Smart: Modern NLP embeddings for accurate clustering.  
- üß∞ Practical: Useful for deduplicating articles, grouping feedback, and more.

**Features**
- Flask-based web UI  
- Real-time clustering feedback  
- Downloadable clustered results  
- Adjustable clustering sensitivity or fixed count

title: "Walkability and Obesity Analysis"

This project explores whether the EPA's National Walkability Index can predict obesity rates when controlling for socioeconomic and access-related variables.

**Key Question**
> Does walkability predict obesity rates when adjusting for other factors?

**üìä Data Sources**
- **EPA SMART Location Database** (walkability, job access, land use)
- **CDC PLACES** (obesity, healthcare access)
Merged by county FIPS codes.

**Methodology**
Multivariate OLS regression with controls for:
- Healthcare access (`ACCESS2_AdjPrev`)
- Population size (`TotalPopulation`)
- Job accessibility (`Ac_Total`, `Ac_Unpr`)
- Demographics (`Pct_AO0`)
- Income (`R_PCTLOWWAGE`)
- Walkability (`NatWalkInd`)

**üìç About NatWalkInd**
EPA's composite walkability score (0‚Äì20) including:
- Street connectivity
- Land use diversity
- Transit proximity

**üìà Key Findings**
- Adjusted R¬≤ = 0.385
- `NatWalkInd` statistically significant (p < 0.001)
- Coefficient = -0.8663: A 1-point rise in walkability reduces obesity by ~0.87 percentage points

Advanced Paste is a productivity tool designed to reduce context-switching in repetitive communication tasks, especially emails. Developed with the Microsoft PowerToys team.

**The Problem**
- 28% of office time is spent on email.
- Existing tools require context switching.
- Leads to cognitive overload and inefficiency.

**The Solution**
- Seamless integration of clipboard and templates.
- Less app switching, more focus.
- Great for roles like Support Engineers with repetitive messaging needs.
