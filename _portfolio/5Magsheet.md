During my time at the Actuated Experiences Laboratory, I led the research of our Magsheet project. With Magsheet, we aimed to find new approaches to haptic interface design that builds upon the ideas from the paper [MagneLayer: Force Field Fabrication by Layered Magnetic Sheets](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376552). While MagneLayer demonstrated the power of combining layered magnetic fields for haptic interactions, Magsheet takes the concept further by integrating these magnetic patterns into a flexible PCB.

# Core Features:

- Ultra-Thin Form Factor: By embedding magnetic field generators directly onto a flexible PCB, Magsheet can be as thin as a sheet of paper, enabling seamless integration into books, folders, clothing, or ultra-slim devices.
  
- Flexibility: Magsheet can wrap around objects like handles, wearables, or irregular surfaces, bringing dynamic haptic feedback to areas where rigid materials would fail.

- Magsheet allows for electronic control of the magnetic fields. This opens the door to dynamic changes in feedback over time, controlled by software or sensors (for example, using hall-effect sensors to detect the position of a magnet, and then using Magsheet to move it to a specified location).

  
# Example Applications:

- Interactive Books: Pages that can produce haptic sensations like bumps, ridges, or textures as you read.

- Wearable Haptic Systems: Clothing that can gently guide or alert the wearer through localized magnetic forces.

- Education and Accessibility Tools: Tactile learning surfaces for students with visual impairments that can update in real-time.
