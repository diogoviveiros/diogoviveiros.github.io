Advanced Paste is a productivity tool designed to reduce context-switching in repetitive communication tasks, like emails. Developed in collaboration with the Microsoft PowerToys team, who are committed to bringing power users a set of open source tool packages for productivity improvements.

**The Problem**

- Existing tools require context switching.
- Leads to cognitive overload and inefficiency.

**The Solution**
- Seamless integration of clipboard and templates.
- Less app switching, more focus.
- Great for roles like Support Engineers with repetitive messaging needs.
