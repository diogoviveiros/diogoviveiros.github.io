Hello! My name is Diogo, I'm currently working as a Business Operations Manager at Microsoft. I graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in Economics, specializing in Data Science. Alongside that, I also pursued minors in Computer Science and Molecular Engineering — because I’ve always been driven by a curiosity for how things work, whether it’s economic systems, hardware, or code.

At my core, I’m someone who loves blending technical know-how with human understanding. I’ve spent time coding in languages like Java, Python, and C, exploring data with SQL and R, and getting hands-on with hardware through KiCad and Arduino/ESP-32 programming. But what really makes me thrive is being able to share that knowledge with others. I genuinely enjoy helping people learn technical concepts, especially when they’re just starting out. That drive probably comes from having lived in different countries and learning to appreciate the value of diverse perspectives.

When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me lifting heavy things, building custom electronics, or watching motorsports.

If you’re curious about my work or just want to chat, feel free to connect with me!
